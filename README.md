# todos_flutter

    Todo apps have always been a good first app for starters to learn something new. I also created this app solely for learning purposes. I have used provider package which is now the recommended way of managing your state inside Flutter apps. So, I will be showing you how you can create a Todo app yourself with flutter using provider as the state management system.
